When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working on something that is a collaboration.  Also it serves as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If someone else pushes a file you are also working on to github, it
  could automatically pull that to your local machine and overwrite your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
  You branch if you are trying something new on your code and are not sure if it will work.
  You clone if you are collaborating on someones work.
  You fork if you are planning to make changes to someones code, that you
  won't push back to them.
