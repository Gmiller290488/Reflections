How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  It was much easier to find the error than when I tried manually

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Lots of saved time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You won't accidentally overwrite a version you wanted to keep for a backup

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some files work in tandem.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you can use git log to see all commits, and git diff to see the differences
    between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You won't be worried about something breaking as it is always possible
    to roll back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To keep a track of my projects.
